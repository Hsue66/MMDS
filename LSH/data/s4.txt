Hwang Ui-jo Emerges as Star Striker from Asian Games.

When asked how he had managed to improve his scoring ability so dramatically, he said, "I just trusted that my teammates would send good passes to me and tried to be prepared."

Hwang appreciated playing with Son the most. Son made five assists during the tournament, three of them on goals scored by Hwang. "We were close when we were on the U-17 team, and we became even closer this time. I hope Heung-min will keep helping me," he said.

The national football team, which won the gold medal at the Asian Games in Indonesia, returned home to an enthusiastic welcome on Monday. The footballers were greeted at Incheon International Airport by a crowd of cheering fans, with some young fans treating them like pop idols.

Fans have expressed excitement about Hwang's excellent performance, saying Korea finally has a competitive striker. They pointed out that he has everything that a good striker needs -- outstanding positioning, accurate shooting, a fast break, and the ability to link play.
